## Overview
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a blend of computer mapping and database technologies used to store, manage, analyse and display geographic data. This subject introduces students to this exciting technology and provides them with the skills and knowledge to design solutions enabling to solve everyday spatial problems in both built and natural environments. Students who complete this subject will have developed knowledge that is immediately applicable in the workplace. The subject also lays the foundations for more advanced studies in geomatics, spatial information systems, and spatial planning. Enrolled students will be encouraged to familiarize themselves with GIS technology before the semester start by online training courses published in LMS.

## Indicative Content
Basic concepts of GIS, including typology of datasets, Design and operationalization of GIS solutions, Application areas of GIS demonstrated through case studies presented by experts in their professions. In parallel, students train in computer labs the use of GIS for data integration, analysis and mapping, translating a specification of a multi-criteria evaluation problem into a workable GIS decision support solution, inspired by the case studies.
